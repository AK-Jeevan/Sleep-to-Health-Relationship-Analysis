# Sleep-to-Health-Relationship-Analysis
This project investigates the relationship between sleep habits and heart rate using a real-world health dataset. By applying multiple linear regression (MLR), the analysis reveals how various lifestyle and physiological factors contribute to heart rate fluctuations.
📦 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains records for individuals across various occupations, with features that span sleep patterns, physical activity, stress, and biometric indicators.

Key features used for prediction include:

Sleep Duration – Total hours slept each night

Quality of Sleep – Self-assessed score from 1 to 10

Physical Activity Level – Daily activity score

Stress Level – Reported stress from 1 (low) to 10 (high)

BMI Category – Weight classification

Daily Steps – Count of steps taken per day

Sleep Disorder – Diagnosis of sleep-related conditions

🎯 Target Variable
Heart Rate – Average heart rate (beats per minute)

⚙️ Modeling Approach
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Regression modeling using statsmodels and scikit-learn

Evaluation via p-values, R², and coefficient interpretation

Feature significance analysis for personalized health recommendations

🎯 Objective
To uncover how sleep quality and associated lifestyle factors predict heart rate, helping guide personalized wellness strategies and health monitoring.
